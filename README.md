# Platosku 2

This is my platformer game (prototype) written in rust.

## TODO / Ideas

 * Player
   * Safe platform edge jumping helping
   * Long press / short press jumping
   * Hitpoints and taking damage (and dying)
 * Boxes/Crates that are breakable
   * And drop loot/coins
 * Throwing things
 * Push blocks
 * Enemies
   * New enemies
 * Map
   * Map editor
   * Platforms (pressing down+jump drops you down)
